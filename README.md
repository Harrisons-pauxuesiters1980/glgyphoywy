OMG, just finished watching Gap, and let me tell you, I have a lot to say, lol. First off, like, how intense was that? I mean, seriously! The characters were... how do I put this... a bit over the top, you know what I mean? But in a good way, like, it kept me hooked. 

> And that one scene where they're just staring at each other? My god, talk about tension! Itâ€™s like, come on, just say something already! ðŸ˜‚ I laughed so hard at some parts where I probably shouldnâ€™t have. Guess thatâ€™s me, always catching the unintentional comedy in dramas.

Downloaded the movie and thought I was just gonna watch a little bit before starting dinner, but nope, ended up glued to the couch, completely hooked. Who needs food when youâ€™ve got drama, am I right?

Was it just me, or did the soundtrack totally not fit in some parts? Like, this epic music playing in the background while theyâ€™re just chilling on the couch. Chill, movie-makers, itâ€™s not that deep. But hey, it adds to the charm, I guess. Keeps you on your toes wondering if the next scene is gonna be a plot twist or just a dude making coffee.

Letâ€™s not even get started on that ending though. What was that even supposed to be? Like, Iâ€™m sitting here scratching my head thinking, there MUST be a sequel in the works, or someone had a laugh just smushing the last scenes together.

> Anyway, if you havenâ€™t watched the movie, you really should give it a go. Save it for a rainy day or whenever you need a little escape. It's got that weirdly addictive quality. Like you almost hate it for how much you enjoyed it, if that makes any sense? ðŸ˜…

Honestly, sometimes these movie nights become way more intense than, like, living real life. Or is that just me losing it? Maybe I should watch something lighter next time. What do you think?
